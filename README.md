### “Practical” is the word of the day.
Web Developer with a focus on functionality. While I find styling and presentation of a web app an interesting challenge, what really drives me is creating the underlying logic of a website. For me, understanding how something 'ticks' will always be more interesting than how it looks. I
always want to know how something works and why it works, before I use it in my projects. And while this makes me 'reinvent the wheel' more often than not, I firmly believe in that one phrase 'Knowledge is power.'

I started my programming experience in Python and to this day it remains my favorite language due to its simple syntax. However, at the time I mostly work in Javascript as a Front End developer with a goal of completing the MERN  stack and becoming a full-stack dev. I create most of my projects using React which I find to be a great and intuitive front-end library.

I also have some experience in Fortran, which was a programming language of choice for Intro to Computer Science course at my University (for some inexplicable reason).



### Pre-Web Development
By education, I am an environmental geologist with a master's degree in geological engineering.  Before switching careers to Web Development I worked as an environmental consultant for 4 years writing Environmental Impact Assessments and Strategic Impact Assessments.

While working as a consultant I also gained significant experience in Geographical Information System software, primarily QGIS.



#### Final thoughs
Recursion is black magic. Change my mind.
