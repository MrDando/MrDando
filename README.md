I'm a self-taught full-stack web developer who leans a bit more on the backend side of web development. While I find the styling and presentation of a web app an interesting challenge, what really drives me is creating the underlying logic of a website. For me, understanding how something 'ticks' will always be more interesting than how it looks.

I started my programming experience in Python and to this day it remains my favorite programming language due to its simple syntax. However, currently I mostly work in Javascript although I recently started switching to Typescript.

I also have some experience in Fortran, which was a programming language of choice for the Intro to Computer Science course at my University.

### Pre-Web Development
By education, I am an environmental geologist with a master's degree in geological engineering.  Before switching careers to Web Development I worked as an environmental consultant for four years writing Environmental Impact Assessments and Strategic Impact Assessments.

While working as a consultant I also gained significant experience in Geographical Information System software, primarily QGIS.
